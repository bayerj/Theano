NIPS 2011 Demonstration Proposal for *Theano: Easy GPU Meta-Programming in Python*
==================================================================================

Technology
----------

*What technology does your demonstration show? What is novel about it? Provide links to any related published material.*

Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.

 * http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/
 * http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/

The two key features for the ML audience are:
 
 * behind-the-scenes GPU meta-programming
 * automatic symbolic differentiation

Theano makes many deep learning algorithms more readable and faster.  It is also useful for recurrent algorithms, particle filtering, sparse coding, and software for Bayesian inference is in development.

Experience
----------

*What is the live and interactive user experience, i.e. what do the users see and do?*

The experience is to get a feel for Theano. We will have experts on hand to
 * do code walk-throughs of simple demonstrations of how to use Theano, 
 * do live-coding on the projector,
 * set up Theano on their laptops,
 * and simply answer questions.

We will also have a GPU-powered machine set up so that people can try logging in by ssh
and running some sample python programs. If we can get Nicolas Pinto's 16 GPU monster computer to Spain,
then we'll set it up on the demonstration table and let people log into it by ssh.
If we cannot transport that computer to spain, then we will set up a monitor with a live video stream of it running
back here in Cambridge, and they can ssh into it just the same.


Readiness
---------

*What is the present state of completion of the demo, i.e. could you show it today, next week, next month? What still needs to be done?*

The core library is ready, it has been relatively stable for over a year.

We have a library of sample programs that demonstrate various learning algorithms,
and it will continue to grow until December.
That library started with the deep learning tutorials, and was extended for the CIFAR NCAP Summer School
this past August. We will extend that library though the fall.

Equipment
---------

*Equipment you will bring. e.g. laptop, robot.*

 * laptop (s)
 * maybe a 16 GPU Monster computer
 * maybe a projector


External URI
------------

*URL for your demo*

Demonstration Table
-------------------

*Does your demo require a complimentary table?* Yes

Poster Board
------------

*Does your demo require a complimentary 190cmx90cm poster board?* Yes

Power Strip
-----------

*Does your demo require a complimentary a power strip?* Yes

Special Needs
-------------

*e.g. robot arena (how large?), multiple poster panels, special lighting requirements (room illumination is directly overhead with only about 50 lux illuminance), video projector, monitor. Please be as specific as possible. You will be charged for the cost of rented equipment, but the final decision regarding equipment may be made after acceptance.*

 * a big monitor would be nice, depending on cost
 * we need a projector, but we could potentially bring our own if procuring one on site is expensive or difficult.
 * we would like to bring over the custom-made GPU supercomputer that Nicolas Pinto
   designed and built (http://pinto.scripts.mit.edu/Research/Monster16GPU) but we don't 
   yet know if we can transport it from the US.  If we cannot, then we will set up a 
   live feed to just show it running here in Cambridge.
